## News Bubble
American life and media consumption has become extremely politically polar especially in recent times. According to a study by Pew Research Center It’s not just about the public’s views on issues, but the way they use media (including social media) and talk about politics with other people. While the most consistent liberals and conservatives both tend to drive broader political discussion, they do so with news and analyses drawn from very different segments of the media landscape, inhabiting a bubble. A filter bubble is a state of intellectual isolation that can result from personalized searches and media habits. This is my attempt at analyzing and clustering news content from differnet news domains.
